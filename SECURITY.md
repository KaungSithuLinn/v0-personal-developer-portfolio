Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:
1. **Email us**: Send an email to `security@example.com` with details of the vulnerability.
2. **Provide details**: Include as much information as possible, such as:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Any relevant logs or screenshots
3. **Use a PGP key**: For secure communication, use the following PGP key:
   ```
   -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

### What to Expect

- If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and notify you once it is resolved.
